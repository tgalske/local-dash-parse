Distribution: Breadth
        Minimum Distribution Credit
Still Needed: You must complete a minimum of 36 distribution credits (through Breadth, Pathway, and Overflow courses). Although some courses may fulfill both Breadth and Pathway requirements, every course counts only once toward the 36-credit distribution requirement. If you are majoring in a Breadth-area discipline (e.g. MATH, HIST), you may apply a maximum of 6 credits in that discipline to your distribution total. You currently have 26, so you still need 10 distribution credits. All students must declare a Pathway by the end of their freshman year.
